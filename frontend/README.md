# Frontend Project Setup

Welcome to the frontend project! This guide provides simple steps to set up the project and run the development server.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14.18+)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlaaBrahim/traitement-image
   ```

2. Navigate to the frontend project directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Development Server

After installing the dependencies, start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the server and open the application in your default browser. It usually runs on `http://localhost:5173`.
